# LR-Refund Bot

LR-Refund is an easy-to-use Discord bot that helps players easily recover lost items and vehicles in-game. It provides a simple and easy way for staff members to generate and distribute recovery codes to players.

## Features

- Automatic refund codes: Staff members can generate a unique code for a lost item, such as a pistol, with a simple `/generatecode WEAPON_PISTOL`.
- In-game refund: The player can then use the generated code with the in-game `/refund` (for example: `/refund [code]`) to get their lost item or vehicle back.

LR-Refund makes the process quick and hassle-free for both staff members and players.

## Usage

### For Staff Members

1. Use the Discord bot to generate a code for a player:
/generatecode WEAPON_PISTOL
This will generate a random code for the specified item (in this case a pistol).

2. Share the generated code with the player.

### For Players

1. Use the ingame command:
/refund [code]
Replace `[code]` with the code provided by the staff member to get your item or vehicle back.
